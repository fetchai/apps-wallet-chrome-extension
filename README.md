react-expanded-animated is a public module I changed a bit
and  must rename hence moving from node-modules

TO INSTALL

in serialization/transaction version flag in node modules
must be changed from 2 to 3 after running npm install, 
then cd into node_modules and run npm run build. This
is temp until I update which version of sdk it is running
on. When I started it the sdk on npm has since been updated
so i need to update which methods I am using.

It runs first index.js in browser or content.js in 
extension

all css is content.css
